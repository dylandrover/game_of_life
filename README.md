# Conway's Game of Life (TensorFlow Edition)

This project is an exercise in Tensorflow. There a number of tutorials that show how Tensorflow can be used to train machine learning algorithms with an emphasis on neural networks. However, I am pretty lazy and not terribly clever and following one of these tutorials, while informative, wouldn't give me a deeper understanding of Tensorflow. Therefore, the goal here was to create a program that did not have a tutorial or anything resembling a tutorial, and try to only use Tensorflow for all the math and logic.
