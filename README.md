# Conway's Game of Life (TensorFlow Edition)

This project is an exercise in Tensorflow. There a number of tutorials that show how Tensorflow can be used to train machine learning algorithms with an emphasis on neural networks. Following one of these tutorials, while informative, feels somewhat restricted. Therefore, the goal here was to create a program that did not have a tutorial or anything resembling a tutorial, and try to only use Tensorflow for all the math and logic.
